	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Being in Software Development isn’t quite the same as being a Graphic Designer or Fine Artist, but that doesn’t mean it’s not creative in its own way. There are many ways in which Software Developers can be creative, including in the way you think to solve a problem: for example, you need to be able to put yourself in the users’ shoes in order to provide a solution, you need to create innovative new systems and functionality and you get to play around and learn new technologies. Creativity also comes into play when trying to design a well-thought complex solution to get the best out of computers. You begin with just a blank screen and a set of abstract ideas to construct your masterpiece using code. Creativity is just one of the many reasons to become a Software Engineer.</p>
